# pyresume
An automated way to create a resume or CV using Python.

## Why?
```RMarkdown``` and  ```pagedown``` provides a powerful interface for users to make resumes or CVs in the ```R``` programming language. 
From my research, no consolidated way exists within Python. 
Rather than keeping work to myself, why not try to make a package that a few people will use potentially?
